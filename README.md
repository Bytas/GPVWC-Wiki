GPVWC-Wiki
==========

Welcome to the GPVWC/wiki github repository, a community driven effort where we try to keep the wiki up to date and useable while it is down/broken! 
Read on if you want to find out how you can read and/or contribute to the wiki in its current state. 

Reading
-------

To read a particular article, first, try to consider the nature of the page. If it is an old page that has no links to the current season, you can just check it on the wiki by surfing to the following link: 

http://en.gpvwc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages

All pages up to the errors started occuring are there, and you will be able to read them.

If it is a recent or incomplete page, try to browse this repository if you can find the .txt file for the perticular page. Once found, follow these steps: 

1. Open the .txt File and select the entire content with ctrl+A 
2. Paste the selected text to your clipboard with ctrl+C
3. Surf to http://en.gpvwc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Test 
4. If you want you can replace the word 'Test' with the title of the .txt file you copied to your clipboard.
5. Press the "edit this page" link on that page
6. Paste the content of your clipboard inside the empty editing space with ctrl+V
7. Press "Show Preview" at the bottom of the page
8. ENJOY! You can read the wiki page you selected. :)

However, you will be unable to save any changes you make to the page,if you want to submit changes to a certain page, read on in the next paragraph

Writing: Basic Users
--------------------

If you are an active Wiki user and would like to get involved in this project by adding updates to certain pages yourself, you can do so as follows. 

1. Surf to http://en.gpvwc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages 
2. Find the page you think is outdated and you want to edit
3. follow the link to the page and press "edit" at the top
4. The current code will pop up, you can edit it as normal and view the changes by pressing "Show Preview"
5. Once done editing, copy the entire code to a .txt file and name it after the page you are editing
6. Surf to http://en.gpvwc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=4126 and make a reply with your .txt file as an attachement
7. I, or some other hardcore User, will add the txt file to the github for others to read.

* If the page you want to create doesn't exist yet, propose a good title yourself. ;)

Writing: Hardcore Users
-----------------------

If you consider yourself one of the driving forces in the wiki-completion process and have an extensive knowledge of how wiki coding works, as well as some respect for the work of others, it might be a good idea to go all hardcore mode on this thing, and provide yourself with the tools to do a serious amount of wiki editing at once.

This can be done by making a personal account on https://github.com and installing the software on your computer.
Once done, you can download all the code from this repository to your local computer, edit the pages you want changed and push the updates back to the net. 


1. make an account on https://github.com 
2. download and install the github software on your PC
3. Surf to http://en.gpvwc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=4126 and make a post explaining you would like to join github as a contributor, providing your github username
4. I'll add you to the repository
5. Make sure to communicate with other contributors about what pages you will take care off, and what other people will be doing. While every single change is reviewable and reversable, we would like to keep it clean and efficient here. :)
6. open up your github software on your pc and click on the GPVWC/wiki repository. Pull the thing to your pc. 
7. All files should be on your machine now, and you can start editing.
8. Once done, publish your 'commit' and sync up with the main branch! 
9. The community thanks you for your effort. :)
